Project built for the TSP 2020-2 subject.

Consists of an Android app that helps students consult information about school procedures, school guide and important school news like conferences and courses.

Students can also buy stuff from other students that are looking for a monetary income like electronic components and food, and also meet to protect each other while returning to the metro station.
